# I'm Leah


## Hello
I am Lingya Hu, a graduate student from Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Science. I always have a passion for learning new techniques, so I implemented multiple personal projects with Spring Boot, MERN and other frameworks. This summer, I improved and rebuilt a large-scale web application with ASP.NET core in C#, collaborating with my co-workers. Right now, **Iâ€™m looking for an opportunity to apply my technology experience, along with my creative problem-solving abilities and good interpersonal skills.**
